# PKNCA.extra: Functionality for non-compartmental analysis using PKNCA

Provides functions to perform NCAs using the PKNCA package as the
underlying computational engine. The PKNCA package provides a great and
stable computational engine, but is somewhat limited (by design) in the
features it provides for data (pre-)processing and interpretation of the
NCA results. This package offers some of that functionality.
