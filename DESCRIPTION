Description: Provides functions to perform NCAs using the PKNCA package
   as the underlying computational engine. The PKNCA package provides
   a great and stable computational engine, but is somewhat limited (by design)
   in the features it provides for data (pre-)processing and interpretation of
   the NCA results. This package offers some of that functionality.
